1. Не (was) here five minutes ago, but you (were) out. 
He (asked) me to tell you that he (would come)
again tonight. 2. (have you read) "The Murder of Roger 
Ackroyd" by Agatha Christie? — No, I (have not read it yet). 
But I (heard) that it (is) a very interesting book. I (will 
read) it as soon as I (get) it. 3. When we (came) to the 
station, the train already (had arrived). The passengers (are 
hurrying) to occupy their seats in the carriages. 4. The concert 
(was) a greater success than we (had expected). We were very 
glad. 5. He (told) me that if no one (would come) to meet me at 
the station, I (could) leave the suitcases in the checkroom and 
go to the hotel where he (had reserved) a room for me. 6. Lanny 
(returned) home after seven years of absence. During these 
seven years he (was studying) in Cape Town where his people (had
sent) him. Lanny was glad at the thought that he (had done) 
what they (had hoped) he (would do) and that soon he (would be) 
among his people again.
